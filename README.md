#security-device
This program will take a string as user input, then will print the action taken (lock or unlock).
To run the program, type the following command in the terminal:
``` $ python3 device.py ```
To run the test, type the following command in the terminal:
``` $ python3 testing.py ```
The test will allow the input of a number between 1-100. Which will be how many iterations will be run for the data sampling. 50 iterations may take more than a minute to run.
The test will return the minimum, maximum, and average symbols generated to unlock the device.
